World Ranks is a website that aggregates a database with information about all countries, such as:
Population, territorial area, language, etc.

# Some Features!
It is possible to filter the search through:
        Name, region or subregion;

   By clicking on a country, you will receive some information, such as:
        Capital, sub-region, language and more!


### Tech

   World Ranks uses only one technology, which is NextJS, a free framework for ReactJS developed by Vercel.
